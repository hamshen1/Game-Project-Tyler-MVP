# Comments for Tyler Anderson

1. Design Review
   This seems like a captivating idea, but it does not follow the specification in the assignment. There are no core features listed
2. Review for Compliance
   The content does not seem offensive or discriminatory. There is violence that would classify this game as either Teen (T) or Mature (M). The works of Shakespeare are now public domain, so I don't see any copywrite issues arising.
3. Constructive Feedback
   **Highlight Strengths:**
   "Aquire the boom stick" is a fantastic mission.
   Props for the boneworks reference.
   **Improvements:**
   I'm interested in clarity on what individual quests ("plays") look like, and what the character is capable of.
4. Enhance Functionality
   I'll try to list core features for your game to fit the Day 1 spec:
   
## Core Features
### Walking
The character can move around using the WASD keys and mouse, like in similar RPGS.
### Shakespearing
Clicking the Q key emits a singlular random Shakespear quote
### Interacting (Speech)
Clicking the interact key (e) allows the character to engage in interactions with the NPCs powered by ChatGPT. The NPCs have information in their context for the user to discover to progress the game.
### Interacting (Carry)
Interacting with objects using (e) makes the character collect the given object, or interact with it if it is a puzzle.

## User Flow
### Loading Screen
The loading screen allows the user to select which "play"/quest to enter. Chapters will unlock sequentially after completing each one. 
### Game Environment
The game environment is where all the core features are implemented, and each quest consists of NPCs and puzzles that the user can interact with
