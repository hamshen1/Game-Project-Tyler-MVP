# Shakespeare Game

As the character, the player will get put into the world of a Shakespeare play. The game will take place following the lore of a play. The game will consist of plays, chapters, and missions.

The loading screen will allow the player to select which play to enter. Then when selecting a play, it will allow the player to select which chapter to play. Chapters will unlock sequentially after completing each one.

The game will take place in a Bonelab (game) vibe, 3D environment, but in a medival, more peaceful setting. Each chapter will consist of doing a few quests/missions to complete the chapter. Sometimes these missions will align with the original text, like spreading lies about Antonio or disguising yourself to get an audience with a noble. But as the play goes on, the missions will become more entertaining, as in, "acquire the boom-stick" and "send forth thy fire". It will culminate in either ending the story in the way it was intended, or going crazy with the "acquired arms" and destroying everything.

For each mission, there will be a puzzle that the player must solve in order to progress the story. However, hidden throughout the level, there will be certain items that will allow the player to mess up the story. The interaction with the game will consist of traveling throughout the level, looking for items, solving puzzles, and talking to characters.
